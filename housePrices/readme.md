[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques]("https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data")

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

- Numerical features
  - Discrete feature
  - Continuous feature
- Categorical features
- Feature visualization
- bar plot(for continous features only)
- box plot
- scatter plot
- histogram

Check how many values are missing!

## 2. Feature Engineering

- Missing Values
- Temporal variables
- Categorical variables
- Outliers removal
- categorical to numerical features conversion
- Feature Scaling
- Using log normal distribution

Here is a skewed data which need to be in log normal distribution.

## 3. Feature Selection

- Selecting models based on weights importance.
- Using **SelectFromModel** sklearn method to select important features.

## 4. training and testing

- Using **train_test_split** to divide data in training and testing.
- Using r2 metric to evaluate the model.
- Visualize the difference between the predicted and actual **'SalePrice'**.
